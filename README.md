# PinterestApp

Designed and implemented a Pinterest-inspired application using ASP.NET and Entity Framework. Utilized ASP.NET for server-side logic and Entity Framework for efficient data modeling and database interactions. 

The application allows users to discover, save, and share content, fostering an interactive online community focused on shared interests.
